## Wherewasi

A tool to view and parse through google location history.


Still very much in progress

TODO:
* build out a way to view the matching data list on a per-day basis. (vue?)
* better map tools, draw lines between likely poins
* smaller point icons
* csv data exporter tool


## Motivation

I'm needing a way to determine my paraglidier flight time for my p3 certification,
so I'm making a tool to process my location history from Google Takeout

## Installation

docker-compose up -d
